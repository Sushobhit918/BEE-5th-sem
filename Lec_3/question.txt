differnece between dependency and dev-dependency?

In Node.js (or any JavaScript project using npm or yarn), dependencies and devDependencies are both packages listed in your package.json file, but they serve different purposes.

1. Dependencies ("dependencies")

These are packages that your project needs to run in production.

    ✅ Required at runtime.

    📦 Examples: express, react, mongoose, etc.


2. DevDependencies ("devDependencies")

These are packages that are only needed during development or testing.

    ❌ Not required in production.

    ✅ Used for development tools like testing, compiling, linting, etc.

    📦 Examples: nodemon, eslint, jest, webpack, babel, etc.
